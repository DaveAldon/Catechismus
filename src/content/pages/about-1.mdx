The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) is one of the most important documents of the Church in the last few decades, especially in the formation of lay people.
Grounded in the Tradition of the Church, Sacred Scripture and the Magisterium, it speaks the language of our times, addressing the main challenges the Church faces in a highly secularized world in the dawn of the third millennium.

The content and structure of the CCC in printed formats utilize a large number of **connections**, such as cross-references between numerals, footnotes, and Biblical references that aid its study. Catechismus presents these connections in a digital form, improving the **user experience** and making them more readily accessible. No other existing digital presentation of the document enables this interactivity.

The four main sections of the document have been color-coded for easier discovery, and alternative titles have been added to these parts and inner sections in the table of contents, in order to make it more easily scannable to the eye.

1. **“Part One: The Profession of Faith”** was given the supplementary title of “Faith” and its content is displayed in <CrossReference type="blue">blue</CrossReference>
2. **“Part Two: The Celebration of the Christian Mystery”** was given the supplementary title of “Liturgy” and its content is displayed in <CrossReference type="red">red</CrossReference>
3. **“Part Three: Life in Christ”** was given the supplementary title of “Life” and its content is displayed in <CrossReference type="teal">teal</CrossReference>
4. **“Part Four: Christian Prayer”** was given the supplementary title of “Prayer” and its content is displayed in <CrossReference type="fuchsia">fuchsia</CrossReference>

Despite being an innovative presentation of the CCC, _Catechismus_ does not aim to alter its content. Rather, its goal is to faithfully present the text of the CCC. Any discrepancy with the Vatican document of the CCC should and will be immediately corrected upon notice.
